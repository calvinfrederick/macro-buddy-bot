# macro-buddy-bot
A Telegram-based nutrition coach that dynamically curates meals from the foods you already have. Users log what theyâ€™ve eaten, set daily calorie &amp; macro targets, and the bot suggests optimal food combinations from their pantry to help them stay on track. Built with Python (FastAPI + python-telegram-bot) and SQLite.
